"Open Cyber Labs" is a laravel web-app that I use for my local air-gapped lab for high school students. 

"Developed" over last summer, this web-app allows for the following functionalities:
-Upload and Manage Virtual Machines via mqtt and poorly made python listeners
-Create courses, classes, and assignments
-Create rosters
-Upload CTF style challenges
-Supports Boot2Root style machines of Bandit Style labs
-Track student progress and capture scores
-Hints and Hint Demerits

Most of these features will be completely buggy. Nothing is user-friendly. I made this for my own use and to match my own workflow. I am not a web-dev or any kind of dev, so don't expect anything good.

I planned to make it more polished and actually apply reasonable development concepts, but I didn't.
